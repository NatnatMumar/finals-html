					<h2> History </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify"> Some 50 million years ago, the archipelago was formed by volcanic eruptions. 
					About 30,000 years ago the earliest inhabitants had arrived from the Asian mainland, perhaps over land bridges built 
					during the ice ages. By the tenth century A.D. coastal villagers welcomed Chinese commerce and settlers, followed by 
					Muslim traders from Borneo. The early inhabitants of the Philippines were Mongoloid descent which are predominant today.
					The gradual spread of Islam from Borneo into the central and northern islands was interrupted by the arrival of the Spanish
					Christians. The Philippines were claimed in the name of Spain in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain,
					who named the islands after King Philip II of Spain. They were then called Las Felipinas. By the 1830's Spanish culture and thought had 
					penetrated into Filipino culture to the extent that the Filipino people began thinking about liberation from Spain. The government of
					Spain developed Filipino agriculture to the point that it was self-sufficient. Fast forward to December 8, 1941 ten hours after the attack 
					on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese military invaded the Philippines. United States forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur withdrew 
					to Java on December 12, 1941. MacArthur promised: "I shall return". General MacArthur kept his promise and returned with a massive amphibious
					force on the island of Leyte in October of 1944. Over the next four months, U.S. forces, with the help of Filipino guerrillas routed the Japanese army.
					After the war, the United Stated restored the pre-war Commonwealth government. By 1946 the Philippines had transformed from a Commonwealth to an independent republic.

					<h2> Geography & Environment </h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify">The Philippines is an archipelago comprised of 7,107 islands in the South China, Philippine, Sulu, 
					and Celebes Seas, along with the Luzon Strait. The topography of the islands is mostly mountainous with narrow to large coastal lowlands, depending 
					on the island. The Philippines is divided into three main geographic areas: the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The climate of the Philippines is tropical 
					marine with a northeast monsoon from November to April and a southwest monsoon from May to October.
					The Philippines, like many other tropical island nations, has problems with deforestation and soil and water pollution. 
					The Philippines' problems with air pollution are especially bad because of large populations in its urban centers.

					<h2> Demographics of the Philippines </h2>
					<h4> Demography of the Philippines records the human population, including its population density, 
					ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects. </h4>
					<img src ="images/demograph.png" width="750px">
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify">The Philippines annualized population growth rate between the years 2015â€“2020 was 1.63%. 
					According to the 2020 census, the population of the Philippines is 109,035,343. The first census in the Philippines was held in 
					the year 1591 which counted 667,612 people. The majority of Filipinos are lowland Austronesians, while the Aetas (Negritos), as well 
					as other highland groups form a minority. The indigenous population is related to the indigenous populations of the Malay Archipelago. 
					Some ethnic groups that have been in the Philippines for centuries before Spanish and American colonial rule have assimilated or intermixed.
					600,000 people from the United States live in the Philippines. They represent 0.56% of the total population. The ethnic groups include Arabs,
					Japanese, Han Chinese and Indians which form parts of the population.

					<h2> Culture </h2>
					<h4> The culture of the Philippines is characterized by cultural diversity. Although the multiple ethnic groups of the Philippine
					archipelago have only recently established a shared Filipino national identity,their cultures were all shaped by the geography and history of the region. </h4>
					<img src ="images/culture.jpg" width="750px">
					<blockquote>
					<p style="indent:20px"; align="justify">The Philippines is a culture in which East meets West. 
					The Filipino people have a distinct Asian background, with a strong Western tradition. The modern Filipino culture developed through
					influence from Chinease traders, Spanish conquistadors, and American rulers. Filipino people tend to be very hospitable, especially to
					Western visitors. Because of their strong ties to Spanish culture, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that 
					seems more Latin than Asian. The family is the basic and most important aspect of Filipino culture. Divorce is prohibited and annulments are rare. 
					The family is the safety net for indivuduals, especially older people, during difficult economic times. Children will often stay with their parents into
					adulthood, only leaving when they get married. Political and business ties are often influenced by family relationships.
